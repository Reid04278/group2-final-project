# Predicting Walmart Store Sales with Machine Learning

## Description 
Our group created an XGBoost model to predict sales for WalMart stores from the years 2010-2013. We preprocessed the data by extracting the year from the dataframe, getting the week 
number and creating a graph. Then, we preprocessed the data using Standardscaler. Next we made our target and features arrays and splitted the data into
testing and training sets. We then created our first XGBoost model. We got an r-squared score of 0.90
Even though our r-squared score was over 0.80, we still optimized the model to see if we can get a higher score.
